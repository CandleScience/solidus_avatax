Solidus Avatax
===========

Avatax integration with Solidus.

Installation
------------

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "solidus_avatax"
```

Then run from the command line:

```shell
bundle install
rails g solidus_avatax:install
```

Configuration
-------------

If you want to notify Avatax about short ships you should configure the
following:

```ruby
Spree::OrderCancellations.short_ship_tax_notifier = ->(unit_cancels) do
  SpreeAvatax::ShortShipReturnInvoice.generate(unit_cancels: unit_cancels)
end
```

Known Issues
------------

1. "Additional tax" (e.g. US taxes) *is* supported but "included tax" (e.g.
   VAT) is *not*.  This feature is not on the roadmap but we'd be willing to
   look at pull requests for it.
2. Note for future development: There is currently a bug in Solidus where the
   "open all adjustments" admin button doesn't work for line item adjustments.
   See
   [here](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/v2.2.2/backend/app/controllers/spree/admin/orders_controller.rb#L103).
   If that bug were ever fixed, we'd want to monkey patch the controller action
   to prevent tax adjustments from ever being re-opened. We always want tax
   adjustments to be "closed", which tells Solidus not to try to recalculate
   them automatically.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to
building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy
app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

Live tests are provided to insure that the Avalara gem works as promised. The
credentials must be provided under `spec/avalara_config.yml` to run them
successfully. See the example YAML for guidance.

```
username: 'USERNAME'
password: 'PASSWORD'
company_code: 'COMPANY'
```

These tests will communicate against the test Avatax API.
